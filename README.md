# [Interactive Travel Map](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~atseewal/vacamap.html "Interactive Travel Map")
Interactive Leaflet map of places I want to visit

## Motivation
I wanted a way to showcase where I have visited and where I want to visit. I also wanted to play around with an API, so I learned some basic interaction with the Google Maps API.

## Skills Showcased
* Google Maps API (searches are performed by keyword and name)
* Leaflet Map Visualization in R
* Basic HTML formatting (tooltips)
* Web Icons
