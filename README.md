# Interactive Travel Map
Interactive Leaflet map of places I want to and have visited.

**NOTE: The R script generates the map. There are some modifications that need to be made to the output that make the map mobile friendly.**

## Motivation
I wanted a way to showcase where I have visited and where I want to visit. I also wanted to play around with an API, so I learned some basic interaction with the Google Maps API.

## Skills Showcased
* Google Maps API (searches are performed by keyword and name)
* Leaflet Map Visualization in R
* Basic HTML formatting (tooltips)
* Web Icons
